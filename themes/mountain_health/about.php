            <h2>Dr. Amanda Chay</h2>
            <p>
            I am a Naturopathic Physician and owner of Mountain 
            Health. Prior to this, I completed pre-medical studies 
            and a degree in Psychology at the University of Regina 
            in Saskatchewan.
            </p>
            <p>
            Combining my love of medicine, psychology and nature I 
            was driven to a career in Naturopathic Medicine. I truly 
            believe in the bodyâ€™s innate desire to heal and that each 
            patient is unique, deserving of individualized treatment. 
            </p>
            <p>
            My goal for you is to be symptom free so you can simply 
            spend more time enjoying every day. I am excited to offer 
            you a more natural approach and work with you on your journey 
            to optimal health.
